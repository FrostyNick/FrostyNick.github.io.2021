	<h1>Hello World?</h1>
	<h4>More like happy birthday</h4>
	<h6>16 Nov 2021</h6>

	<p id="birthday-2021">That's what it is today ðŸŽŠ I'm now <em>too many numbers</em> years old ðŸ¤¯ One thing I found out right on my birthday is how to set up a wesite on GitHub. <span class="warning">WARNING: This website may be very boring. I'm just soo boring.</span> But more importantly, I just made this website today. And it's been like a year since I've been writing HTML code. Give me some time, and this website will be something! I've got too many ideas, so I'll probably put one or two of those ideas here.</p>
	<p>
		Ideas:
		<ul>
			<li>Why am I not writing this in markdown? It's just better... I guess for practice.</li>
			<li>Do your homework</li>
			<li>Ok I actually need to find my list of ideas and vomit the ideas into here. But for now, homework is more important. And a dark mode lol ðŸ˜‰</li>
			<li>This boomer font has gotta change.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>In the meantime... you can check out a previous website I've made for web design: <a href="https://nick2020.codehs.me/">nick2020.codehs.me</a> Maybe I should link it to this website somewhere for archive purposes.</p>
